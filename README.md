# 100-days-of-ML-challenge by Siraj Raval at https://github.com/llSourcell/100_Days_of_ML_Code

My 100 days of ML start today, 17 January 2019.
I will be working on some ML problems that I'm interested in, particularly: Fx price movements prediction, buildings stability and deformation estimation, natural language processing.

For the technologies, I will be using, Python, C/C++ and Java will be the main programming languages ; Google Colaboratory will be used for implementing most of the source codes as Jupyter notebooks.
The ML models will be developed on ML cloud platforms:　ＡＷＳ　ａｎｄ　Ｇｏｏｇｌｅ　ＭＬ　ｐｌａｔｆｏｒｍ　ｍａｉｎｌｙ．
If possible, will try the performance of GPUs (with CUDA) and of Raspberry PI.

Pledge: an hour of ML per day from 17 Jan to 27 Apr
