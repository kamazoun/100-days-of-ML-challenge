100 Days Of ML Code


Day 0: January 17, 2019

Today's Progress: Created the github structure, picked the problems to work on and gathered dataset links

Next step: Check all the datasets to find the best ones to use. Find resources to progress with during the development of our project

Thoughts: I had a good start. I managed to keep focused for an hour straight for ML. I hope to keep going.

Day 1: January 18, 2019

Today's Progress: Today, I started my hour by going to ML introduction by Google. Unfortunately, I have only been able to complete the guide to the introduction to Pandas by Google.

Next step: COnsidering what I know of Pandas and Python globally (including Tensorflow and other resources I will have to use to complete the tutarial of ML by Google), the next step will be to improve my skills on these subjects before diving into the development of my projects. So tomorrow I will allocate more time for my study of Python API used for the tutorial and hopefully start the tutorial itself.

Thoughts: I think I am learning a lot but I should allocate more time and make more efforts for more efficient and faster learning of 'accessory' knowledge.

Day 2: January 19, 2019
Today's Progress: Today, I started learning tensorflow, and got stuck at a certain point. Something's not right. I need to fix something.

Next step: Fixing that thing 

Thoughts: Well, as I am already in the challenge I'll just keep going. Tomorrow, see ya

Day 3: January 20, 2019
Today's Progress: Today, during the hour allocated to ML, I browsed some resources.

Next step: Assign more time per day to learn more about Python and TensorFlow libraries and API that will be used during the study

Thoughts: RAS

Day 4: January 21, 2019
Today's Progress: Today I did nearly nothing

Next step: Unknow

Thoughts: Tomorrow I will review the bases

Day 5: January 22, 2019
Today's Progress: Ok, today I read a lot of literature. It brought me to scikit-learn. Have started it, will contitnue.

Next step: Progress on scikit-learn!!!

Thoughts: Everything will be alright, just go, just keep going.

Day 6: January 23, 2019
Today's Progress: I brownsed some content to give a better direction to my studies of ML. Particularly, got some books from the lib for Tensorflow from the basics of Pyhton. Useful for me I think, as I need to focus on the Python "essentials" for ML.

Next step: Tomorrwow start with the books, advanced in Python before tackling Scikit-learn and Tensorflow at once

Thoughts: Good

Day 7: January 24, 2019
Today's Progress: I start reading my book, learn general knownledge about Predictive Analysis and did some Pyhton

Next step: Continue with these books, quicker

Thoughts: Still good. Hbd bro

Davy Bd. Day off.

Day 9: January 26, 2019
Today's Progress: After a day off to chill, I came back into the mathematical background needed to understand the principles of PA. More to do about PCA and SVD.

Next step: EigenVs, PCA, SVD

Thoughts: NA

Link to work: NA
