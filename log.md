100 Days Of ML Code


Day 0: January 17, 2019
Today's Progress: Created the github structure, picked the problems to work on and gathered links datasets

Next step: Check all the datasets to find the best ones to use. Find resources to progress with during the development of our project

Thoughts: I had a good start. I managed to keep focused for an hour straight for ML. I hope to keep going.
