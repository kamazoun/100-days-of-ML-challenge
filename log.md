100 Days Of ML Code


Day 0: January 17, 2019

Today's Progress: Created the github structure, picked the problems to work on and gathered dataset links

Next step: Check all the datasets to find the best ones to use. Find resources to progress with during the development of our project

Thoughts: I had a good start. I managed to keep focused for an hour straight for ML. I hope to keep going.

Day 1: January 18, 2019

Today's Progress: Today, I started my hour by going to ML introduction by Google. Unfortunately, I have only been able to complete the guide to the introduction to Pandas by Google.

Next step: COnsidering what I know of Pandas and Python globally (including Tensorflow and other resources I will have to use to complete the tutarial of ML by Google), the next step will be to improve my skills on these subjects before diving into the development of my projects. So tomorrow I will allocate more time for my study of Python API used for the tutorial and hopefully start the tutorial itself.

Thoughts: I think I am learning a lot but I should allocate more time and make more efforts for more efficient and faster learning of 'accessory' knowledge.
